# Tailwind v4+ PostCSS/Next.js Fix

1. Remove @tailwindcss/postcss (not needed for Tailwind v4):
   npm uninstall @tailwindcss/postcss

2. Delete node_modules and package-lock.json to clear cache:
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

3. Reinstall all dependencies:
   npm install

4. Build the project:
   npm run build

# Your postcss.config.js should be:
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};

### 3. Required Packages

Install these prerequisites:

```bash
# Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
npm install next react react-dom typescript tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

# Linting & Formatting
npm install --save-dev eslint prettier

# Forms & Validation
npm install react-hook-form zod

# Testing
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

# Headless CMS Client (optional, e.g., Sanity)

---

### 4. Routing

- Each page in `src/pages/` is a route (Next.js file-based routing).
- Example routes:
  - `/` → Homepage
  - `/services` → Services
  - `/portfolio` → Portfolio/Case Studies
  - `/about` → About Us
  - `/contact` → Contact
  - `/blog` → Blog/Insights
  - `/careers` → Careers
  - `/faq` → FAQ
  - `/quote` → Request a Quote

---

### 5. Controllers

- For static sites, controllers are not required.
- If using API routes (e.g., for forms, CMS integration), add files in `src/pages/api/`.
- Example: `src/pages/api/contact.ts` for handling contact form submissions.

---

### 6. Styles

- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- Global styles in `src/styles/globals.css`.
- Custom themes (dark/light mode) via Tailwind config.

---

### 7. Next Steps

1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
2. Scaffold pages and components as per folder structure.
3. Set up routing and navigation.
4. Integrate forms and validation.
5. Connect to CMS if dynamic content is needed.
6. Add SEO tags and accessibility features.
7. Write tests for critical components.

### Innovative & New Tech Ideas for Components

1. **AI-Powered Contact/Quote Assistant**
   - Integrate AI (e.g., OpenAI API) to help users describe their project, auto-suggest features, or answer questions in real-time.

2. **Motion & Micro-Interactions**
   - Use Framer Motion for smooth section transitions, animated buttons, and interactive cards.

4. **Live Collaboration**
   - Enable real-time chat or collaborative editing for quote requests using Yjs or Socket.io.

6. **Dark/Light Mode with System Preference**
   - Use Tailwind’s dark mode and auto-detect user’s OS theme.

8. **Smart Animations**
   - Animate section reveals as users scroll using Intersection Observer API + Framer Motion.

For a "show off" effect, consider these modern, eye-catching animations:

Parallax Scrolling:
Background images or elements move at different speeds as you scroll, creating depth.
Animated Gradient Backgrounds:
Gradients that smoothly shift colors or directions (CSS or Framer Motion).
Section Reveal with Scale/Rotate:
Sections scale up or rotate slightly as they enter the viewport (Framer Motion).
3D Card Flip:
Portfolio or service cards flip in 3D on hover (CSS transform or Framer Motion).
Glassmorphism Blur Reveal:
Overlay with blur and fade-in for hero or modal sections.
SVG Path Drawing Animation:
Animate SVG logos or icons as if they’re being drawn live.
Confetti or Particle Burst:
Trigger a confetti burst on form submission or button click (use canvas-confetti).

This skeleton provides a scalable, modern foundation for your company website,
